# Delivery_2020.02.07.08.00
This is our 8th Delivery for the scalextric SPWA that we are currently in the process of building. The delivery expected us to deliver on some of the implementation stages that we mapped out on our [Trello Task Board](https://trello.com/b/KRiJrWLA/tasks) for our Sprint 8.
## Links to the deliverable content:
In this sprint we started implement the parts of the application that we had researched and designed. Please find below some of the implementations that we have designed for testing within our application:

- We had to work on devopling a thumb sldier that will act as a trigger for the acceleration of our car within our SPWA. The following repo was used to create our throttle with an output value that we could be used in JavaScript: [thumb-slider-css repo](https://github.com/liveprojects-zuba/thumb_slider-css).
- We had to figure out how we would change the game state in angular. We created another repo that demonstrated how to tie different elements together and present different state changes within a SPWA: [game-states-changes repo](https://github.com/liveprojects-zuba/games_state_changes).
### Additional content not specifically required in our sprint outline:
[Investigation Board](https://trello.com/b/OISN7iJA/investigations](https://trello.com/b/OISN7iJA/investigations)) - a [Trello](https://trello.com/en-GB](https://trello.com/en-GB)) board used to familiarise ourselfs with the tools and technologies that we will need to understand in our project. 

[Features Board ](https://trello.com/b/TnI2w7yA/features) - a [Trello](https://trello.com/en-GB](https://trello.com/en-GB)) board used to understand all the elements of the application that we will need to implement the application. We will need to refer back to this board in the implementation phase.

## Summary
We started on our implementation of our application phase and made progress with core concepts of our application. Additionally we continued to update our features and investigations boards accordingly.
