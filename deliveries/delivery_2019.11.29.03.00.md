# Delivery_2019.11.29.03.00

This is the delivery for Sprint 3 of our project. This sprint was a continuation of our last sprint as it was incomplete. there are still elements of the sprint that need to be completed and will continued to be developed through Sprint 4 as well.

## Links to deliverable content:

[Features Board](https://trello.com/b/TnI2w7yA/features) - Continued to develop the aspects of our SPWA with MQTT. Currently we have the majority of the UI elements completed as well as the MQTT definitions and Data definitions (in JSON).

[Investigations Board](https://trello.com/b/OISN7iJA/investigations) - Continued to add content to the board as we developed our understanding of MQTT, JSON and AngularJS

> The deliverable content is all being made avaliable online using [Trello](https://trello.com/en-GB). It is public and can be viewed by anyone.

## Additional Linked Content
We have raised two issues with the original branch of the MQTT definitions:

1) [SensorId issue](https://github.com/aliceliveprojects/pi_scalextric_mqtt/issues/2) - we were not able to access the sensorId's when the car passed the line (sensor).
2) [Clear MQTT data](https://github.com/aliceliveprojects/pi_scalextric_mqtt/issues/1) - we would like to be able to clear the stored data when the PI starts up (or have the option too).

> Both issues have been raised on Github and are being dealt with accordingly. Follow the links above for more details.

### Summary
We will continue to develop our features board during the next Sprint. Additionaly, we will also start to plan out the implementation stages of development for the sprints 5 through 9.
